"# Bank-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis" 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and segment customers based on various demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes. By identifying distinct customer segments, the goal is to derive actionable insights that can inform targeted marketing strategies and improve customer engagement and retention.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is personal_banking_customer_segmentation.csv, which contains various customer attributes such as age, income level, transaction volume, and more.

#### Methodology
##### 1. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values and duplicates.
Feature Engineering: Created new features like age groups, income level groups, high-value customer indicator, transaction-to-balance ratio, debt-to-income category, and churn risk category.

##### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary Statistics: Calculated descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical columns.
Data Distributions: Visualized data distributions using histograms.
Categorical Data Analysis: Investigated counts and distributions of categorical variables using count plots.

##### 3. Correlation Analysis
Correlation Matrix: Plotted a heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical variables.
Relationship Analysis: Explored relationships between variables using scatter plots with regression lines.

##### 4. Customer Segmentation
Clustering: Applied K-means clustering to segment customers based on scaled numerical features.
Evaluation: Determined the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette scores.
Insights: Analyzed cluster characteristics and identified key differences using visualizations and statistical tests.

##### 5. Insights and Strategy
Demographic and Behavioral Analysis: Examined demographic and behavioral patterns within each cluster.
Marketing Campaign Strategies: Developed personalized marketing strategies based on cluster insights.
Performance Tracking: Defined performance metrics and adjusted strategies based on campaign performance.

## Results
Segment Characteristics: Summarized average metrics and demographic profiles for each cluster.
Visualization: Presented visual summaries such as bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots to illustrate insights.

### Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into customer segmentation within the personal banking sector. By understanding distinct customer segments and their preferences, banks can tailor their marketing efforts and improve customer satisfaction and retention.
